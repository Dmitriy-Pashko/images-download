1) node modules in git ignore so use npm i
2) to run project type npm run start-dev(starts both react end node servers)
3) As for db I m using mlab, so I m not sure how to properly back up it. But you can use my mlab profile(login:fogit, password:0025557l). And to access db go to images(user:god, password:blessrng7)
4)I dont have time to validate form input, but it should check if it is not emty and it has .png .jpg or .jpeg extentions
